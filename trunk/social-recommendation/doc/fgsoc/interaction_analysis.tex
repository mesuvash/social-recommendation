\section{Interaction Analysis}

In this section we analyze the informativeness of Interaction SAGS,
namely those SAGs that are built w.r.t. a user $u$'s interactions.
A general method for measuring the amount of information that a 
feature $X$ provides w.r.t. predicting another variable $Y$ (in this
case likes or dislikes) is to calculate its conditional entropy:
\begin{align*}
H(Y&|X=True)\\
& = -\sum_{y\in{(\like,\dislike)}} p(y|X=true) \ln( p(y|X=true))
\end{align*}
In general, a lower conditional entropy indicates a more informative
feature.

As defined in Sec~\ref{sec:methodology}, we have three distinctions for user
interactions: modality, action, and directionality.  First we analyze
various interactions individually and jointly to understand what
interactions define SAGs with a high social affinity for a user $u$'s
preferences.  To this end, we make a few observations from the
conditional entropy analysis of Table~\ref{table:ce_interaction}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users seem to have a stronger preferential affinity with those
  they interact with on videos vs. other modalities.  This could be
  due to the fact that video viewing is time-consuming and users
  inherently only watch the videos of those whose preferences they
  often share.
\item Tagging has a slightly better conditional entropy than
  commenting and liking.% indicating that tagging.
\item A user is more likely to share preferences with someone who she
  initiates the interaction with (outgoing) vs. with someone who
  initiates the interaction with her (incoming).  As an extreme
  instance of this, we note that while outgoing photo and video
  interactions are most informative, it appears that incoming photo
  and video interactions are least informative.
\end{itemize}

In figure \ref{Fig2} we plot conditional entropy of modality and
action for incoming/outgoing interactions constrained to links
liked by at least $k$ friends in the SAG.  Figure \ref{Fig2} reiterates
many observations made above for various $k$.  In addition, we note that
%\begin{itemize}
%% NOTED ABOVE NOW
%  \item Some interactions are more predictive than other. For
%    eg. videos and photo interactions were found to be significantly
%    more predictive than post and link interactions. Similarly,
%    tagging action is often more predictive than commenting and
%    liking.
%  \item As noted by previous work~\cite{saez2011high}, we observe that
%    outgoing interactions are more predictive than incoming
%    interactions. Furthermore, the differentiation between
%    predictiveness modalities and actions is more pronounced in
%    outgoing interactions than in incoming interactions.
%  \item 
preference affinity with a SAG increases as more people in the SAG
like the item --- then the more likely a user is to like an item.
While incoming interactions were not as predictive as outgoing
interactions for the same $k$, we note that higher $k$ for an incoming
interaction can be more predictive than lower $k$ for an outgoing
interaction.  This exhibits repeated exposure properties of epidemic
models for social networks~\cite{Golub2010selectionbiase}.
