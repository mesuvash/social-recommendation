\caption{Conditional Entropy  of modalities/activities for incoming/outgoing interactions vs. item liked by at least $k$ friends.  Increasing $k$ generally has a stronger influence on informativeness
than other features of interaction SAGs (modality, action, or direction), with the
exception of the outgoing-modality.}

In this section we analyse the informativeness of Interaction Social
Affinity Features (ISAFs), namely user interactions according to their
modality, type, and direction, as described in
Sec~\ref{sec:methodology}.

%namely those SAGs that are built w.r.t. a user $u$'s interactions.
A general method for measuring the amount of information that a 
feature $X^{u,i}_k$ provides w.r.t. predicting a user preference $\likes(u,i)$ (in this
case, just $\true$ or $\false$) is to calculate its conditional entropy:
\begin{align*}
&H(\likes(u,i) | X^{u,i}_k=\true)\\
& = -\sum_{y\in{(\true,\false)}} p(\likes(u,i)=y|X^{u,i}_k=\true) \\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \;\;\;\; \cdot \ln( p(\likes(u,i)=y|X^{u,i}_k=\true))
\end{align*}
In general, a lower conditional entropy indicates a more informative
feature. Here we measure the conditional entropy $H(\likes(u,i)| X^{u,i}_k=\true)$
rather than mutual information $I(\likes(u,i); X^{u,i}_k)$, as we found 
that mutual information is highly correlated with (and dominated by) the 
frequency of the feature $X^{u,i}_k=\true$ in the dataset.

%As defined in Sec~\ref{sec:methodology}, we have three distinctions for user
%interactions: modality, action, and directionality.  
First we analyse various interactions to understand what
interactions define SAGs with a high affinity for a user $u$'s
preferences.  To this end, we make a few observations from the
conditional entropy analysis of Table~\ref{table:ce_interaction}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interaction on {\em videos} seem to have a stronger preferential affinity 
than other modalities such as links, posts and photos.  This could be
  due to the fact that video viewing is time-consuming and users
  inherently only watch the videos of those whose preferences they
  often share.
\item Tagging has a slightly better conditional entropy than
  commenting and liking, potentially because tagging a user
  often indicates a direct social interaction (appearing in a photo
  or video together) that provides evidence of affinity between two
  users. 
  % indicating that tagging.
\item A user is more likely to share preferences with someone who she
  initiates the interaction with (outgoing) vs. with someone who
  initiates the interaction with her (incoming).  As an extreme
  instance of this, we note that while outgoing photo and video
  interactions are \emph{most} informative in the last table of
  Table~\ref{table:ce_interaction}, it appears that incoming photo and
  video interactions are \emph{least} informative.
\end{itemize}

In Fig~\ref{Fig2} we plot the conditional entropy of modality and
action for incoming/outgoing interactions constrained to links
liked by at least $k$ friends in the SAG (measuring the implicit or explicit
exposure of a user to their friends preferences via a SAG).  Fig~\ref{Fig2} reiterates
many observations above for various values of fixed $k$.  In addition, we note that
preference affinity with a SAG increases as more people in the SAG
like the item. 
While incoming interactions were not as predictive as outgoing
interactions for the same $k$, we note that higher $k$ for an incoming
interaction \emph{can be more predictive} than lower $k$ for an outgoing
interaction.  Similar principles hold for modality and action vs. $k$ --- a larger $k$
is generally more predictive than the individual variation among modality and action,
the one exception being the modality-outgoing analysis.
%Note that these graphs are cumulative in $k$, different from the 
%exposure curve on exactly $k$ friends~\cite{Romero2011hashtag}. 
Overall, these observations 
suggest a large cumulative number of friend preferences in an interaction SAG can be more predictive
than other features of the interaction SAG.
%which can be translated into future feature engineering in SAF-based recommender system design. 
Further investigation is needed to pinpoint whether or not there are
diminishing returns on repeated
exposures~\cite{Romero2011hashtag,ver2011stops} on $k$, and how this
could be leveraged into future feature engineering in SAF-based
recommender system design.
%to design SAF-based recommendation algorithms
%and their features
%We observed that 
%\begin{itemize}
%% NOTED ABOVE NOW
%  \item Some interactions are more predictive than other. For
%    eg. videos and photo interactions were found to be significantly
%    more predictive than post and link interactions. Similarly,
%    tagging action is often more predictive than commenting and
%    liking.
%  \item As noted by previous work~\cite{saez2011high}, we observe that
%    outgoing interactions are more predictive than incoming
%    interactions. Furthermore, the differentiation between
%    predictiveness modalities and actions is more pronounced in
%    outgoing interactions than in incoming interactions.
%  \item 

%This exhibits repeated exposure properties of epidemic
%models for social networks~\cite{Golub2010selectionbiase}.
