Collaborative filtering algorithms suffer from the user cold-start problem,
where no historical information about user is available. One of the advantage of SAF is that 
the social affinity features for a user-item are defined in terms of the user's affinity groups(ASAG/ISAG).
Hence, the SAF learning is quite independant of individual user's data. 

For user cold-start analysis, we create 10 fold train-test set where users in train and test set are mutually exclusive
and each test set consists of 10\% of the total users. We hold out 30\% of each user's data from the test set 
and train two SAF predictors namely: \textit{cold-start} and \textit{non cold-start} predictor.
We train cold-start predictor using training set, whereas non cold-start predictor is trained with additional 
held out data from test set. Finally, we evaluate the performance of cold-start and non cold-start predictor on remaining 70\% 
of test data. In fig~\ref{fig:coldstart} we clearly see that the accuracy \footnote{ The slight decrease in accuracy for non cold-start case compared to 
fig~\ref{Fig1} is due to the fact that the training set consists of only 30\% of test set users data and test 
set is biased to small set of test users.} of  SAF predictor for cold-start is comparable
to non cold-start case, which indicates that SAF performs quite well for cold-start users where most of the
existing methods fail. Hence, unlike standard (social) collaborative filtering techniques, SAF is robust to user 
cold-start problem.
