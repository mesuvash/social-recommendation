Social networks such as Facebook allow users to create a rich and verbose profile composed of both user specific interactions (such as 
comment and message passing, tags, likes) and user preferences (such as favourite movies and music, group memberships, page likes). 
These distinct components of a users profile can be leveraged to gauge their affinity with certain links and ultimately predict their
explicit like preferences.

The goal of this thesis is to decipher which of these aforementioned affinity measures are truly predictive of a users like preferences.

The success of our predictions are evaluated using the machine learning algorithms of  
\emph{Naive Bayes}, \emph{Logistic Regression} and \emph{Support Vector Machines}, results are compared to previous 
work using the state of the art social collaborative filtering technique of \emph{Social Matchbox} as a baseline. 
The data set is sourced from a set of over 100 Facebook users and their interactions with over 39,000+ friends during a four month period.

Our analysis has shown that user interactions in themselves are not highly predictive of user likes, while user preferences are. We conclude 
by analysing a combination of the most predictive user preference measures, offer a summary of our work to date and propose recommendations
for additional research in this area.
