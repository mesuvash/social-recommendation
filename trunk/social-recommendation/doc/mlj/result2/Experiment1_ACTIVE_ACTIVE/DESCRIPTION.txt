Trained on ACTIVE data and tested on ACTIVE data.

10-fold cross validation. Random number generator was seeded so all experiments had the exact same fold.

For SVM, used LibSVM.
For Logistic Regression, used LibLinear. MaxEnt version just dropped the dislike data. The SolverType used for LibLinear was L1R_LR.

For everything else, own code.

Tuned parameters by using 1E-10 to 1E10, showing only the most optimal results. For SVM and Logistic Regression, parameters were tuned from 2E-15 to 2E15.
