TRAIN ON UNION data and tested on ACTIVE data.
UNION data here is the ACTIVE data used in Experiment 1 plus the all links liked by all the LinkR users in the PASSIVE data.

10-fold cross validation. Folds are the same as in Experiment 1, but for each fold run all the passive likes data are added into the training data.

For SVM, used LibSVM.
For Logistic Regression, used both LibLinear (LogisticRegressionLibLinear and LogisticRegressionLibLinearMaxEnt) and LingPipe (LogisticRegressionLaplacE). 

The SolverType for LibLinear was L1R_LR and for the LingPipe the prior type was laplace.

Tuned parameters by using 1E-10 to 1E10, showing only the most optimal results. For SVM and Logistic Regression, parameters were tuned from 2E-15 to 2E15.
