% motivate socical recommendation 
Online social networks such as Facebook record an very rich set of user
preferences  (likes of links, posts, photos, videos), user traits
and interactions (conversation streams, tagging, group memberships,
interests, personal history and demographic data).  In the context of
both recent work on social recommendation~\cite{sorec,ste,lla} and
information diffusion in social network analysis
~\cite{Goel2012structure,Romero2011hashtag,Bakshy2012chamber}, 
it is important to know which of these interactions or common traits
are actually reflective of common preferences.

To obtain quantitative answers to this question, 
we have built a Facebook App to collect a set of 
detailed user information and detailed interaction history 
available through the Facebook Graph API. 
We recommend links to each App user from the timeline of their 
friends and non-friends, and we record users' explicit likes 
and dislikes for the links being recommended to them. 
Our recent work~\cite{anonymous} designed new objective functions
for social recommendation that out-perform state-of-the-art, 
In this work, we further explore the role of detailed user preferences 
and interactions for recommendation, called {\em social affinity filtering}.

In the 4-months interaction trace from 119 app users and their 38,000+ friends, 
we use detailed history of 23 different interaction types on users' timeline, 
along with their preferences on 3000+ groups, 4000+ favorites, and 10,000+ pages. 
%Do fine-grained social interactions help predict user preferences?
We found that social affinity filter significantly 
outperform social recommendation by up to 0.06 in accuracy.

%In this paper,
%we provide empirical answers for questions such as the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%%%lexing: make it sound a bit less technical and maintain the specificity, this is icwsm, hem
%%\item What is the probability that 
%\item How likely will a random user $u$ like
%photos that have been liked at least $k$ times by friends? 
%Or friends whose posts $u$ has commented on?
%%\item What is the probability that a random user $u$ will like any
%\item How likely will a random user $u$ like a
%link that is liked at least $k=2$ times by friends sharing common interests
%(movies, television, etc.), or sharing life history (same school or employer)? 
%What if the maximum number of friends sharing this interest is at most $n$?
%%\item What is the probability that a random male user $u$ 
%\item How likely will a male user $u$ like
%items liked at least $k=1$ times by his female friends?
%\end{itemize}

%While many of these queries may seem very narrow, we note that subtle
%changes in the query conditions and parameters above can lead to
%drastic swings in predictive probability.  For example, in the above
%queries, large variations in probability may be 
%observed by changing photo likes to post likes, changing
%wall comment interactions to photo comments, changing from $k=1$ to
%$k=2$ or $n=2$ to $n=4$, and changing the group definition from common
%school to common employer.

\eat{
To better understand these subtleties and to understand what
social interactions and user traits reflect common preferences on
Facebook, we proceed in the following sections to describe our data,
our experimental methodology, and various analyses according to our
methodology that shed light on the above questions. 
On one hand our observations confirm certain observations made previous 
on different networks, such as the diminishing returns of repeated exposures, 
on the other we also see a few new clues such as 
that very specific types of outgoing interactions are more predictive 
than other interactions. 
We then conclude with a summary of the key novel observations arising
from this study.
