% motivate socical recommendation 
Social networks such as Facebook record an very rich set of user
preferences  (likes of links, posts, photos, videos), user traits
and interactions (conversation streams, tagging, group memberships,
interests, personal history and demographic data).  In the context of
both recent work on social recommendation~\cite{sorec,ste,lla} and
information diffusion in social network analysis
~\cite{lerman2010information,Romero2011hashtag,Bakshy2012chamber}, 
it is important to know which of these interactions or common traits
are actually reflective of common preferences.

To evaluate this question, we have built a Facebook App to collect a
large subset of user information available through the Facebook App
API. We have recuited over 100 users who have agreed to use this App for over a 4
month period.  This provides us with access to full interactions
for these App users with their over 39,000+ friends. This is a sufficiently-rich dataset
for  performing a fine-grained analysis of what user interactions
and user interests are predictive of preferences, 
expressed as ``likes'' on Facebook. In this paper,
we provide empirical answers for questions such as the following:
\begin{itemize}
%%lexing: make it sound a bit less technical and maintain the specificity, this is icwsm, hem
%\item What is the probability that 
\item How likely will a random user $u$ like
photos that have been liked at least $k$ times by friends? 
Or friends whose posts $u$ has commented on?
%\item What is the probability that a random user $u$ will like any
\item How likely will a random user $u$ like a
link that is liked at least $k=2$ times by friends sharing common interests
(movies, television, etc.), or sharing life history (same school or employer)? 
What if the maximum number of friends sharing this interest is at most $n$?
%\item What is the probability that a random male user $u$ 
\item How likely will a male user $u$ like
items liked at least $k=1$ times by his female friends?
\end{itemize}

While many of these queries may seem very narrow, we note that subtle
changes in the query conditions and parameters above can lead to
drastic swings in predictive probability.  For example, in the above
queries, large variations in probability may be 
observed by changing photo likes to post likes, changing
wall comment interactions to photo comments, changing from $k=1$ to
$k=2$ or $n=2$ to $n=4$, and changing the group definition from common
school to common employer.

To better understand these subleties and to understand what
social interactions and user traits reflect common preferences on
Facebook, we proceed in the following sections to describe our data,
our experimental methodology, and various analyses according to our
methodology that shed light on the above questions. 
On one hand our observations confirm certain observations made previous 
on different networks, such as the diminishing returns of repeated exposures, 
on the other we also see a few new clues such as 
that very specific types of outgoing interactions are more predictive 
than other interactions. 
We then conclude with a summary of the key novel observations arising
from this study.
