We built a Facebook App\footnote{Name and link omitted
for anonymity.} to collect information about users, 
their interactions and preferences.  
%data about Facebook users and their Facebook friends
%are collected through our Facebook App. 
Our dataset contains information about each App user, along with a
subset of information about their friends visible to the App.  The
data collection is performed with full permission from the user and in
accordance with an approved Ethics Protocol\footnote{Link omitted for
anonymity.}.

Over 200 users installed the Facebook App sometime during the
evaluation period. At any time, around 100 users have actively used
the App. From these core App users, the App has access to their
detailed Facebook profiles and their interactions with a total of
39,850 friends.
%interaction data.  
While we have complete interaction data for the App
users with their friends, and profile data (including
wall post data) for the App users and friends, we do not have complete
interactions for the App users' friends (unless they themselves are
App users).  Hence in the forthcoming analysis, we limit our
evaluation to App users for which we are assured to have full
interaction data.

Our App tracks many user (and their friends') details and interactions
on Facebook.  Interactions that occur through wall posts provide a
rich variety of content and interaction data.  We distinguish four
Facebook items from wall posts: general posts (e.g., status updates,
activity updates such as new friends, and interactions such as the
user liked these pages), links, photos and videos. Four main
interactions on these items are permitted by Facebook: posting an item
to a friend's wall, commenting, liking, and tagging\footnote{Some
Facebook interaction features such as liking comments were introduced
after App user studies began and so are not tracked.}.  The App does
not track deletions of these items and interactions (e.g., unlike) for
performance reasons and we found very few deletions during an initial
testing stage.

%% Scott edited up to this point: please don't undo unless something
%% stated is incorrect.  We cannot use the name LinkR b/c it reveals
%% who we are.  I deleted some details of the ethics protocol as they
%% are not needed in this submitted version of the paper for review,
%% can add in camera-ready if needed.  Changed object -> item to be
%% consistent with later terminology.

%% Nguyen: please edit from this point on, only including statistics
%% that are relevant to data shown in the various plots, plus age
%% info as well (since this is useful to know).  So for example, 
%% you can comment out all non-gender, non-age demographics (locale, 
%% location, etc.) as well as unused table data (e.g., note that *only*
%% education and school -- first two rows of Table 3 are needed).
%% SVN has the record if we ever need to add this data back in.
%%
%% I did a search replace of LinkR with App... need to fix some 
%% awkward mentions.
%%
%% In short make sure all data mentioned is relevant to evaluation
%% section, other information is superfluous.

We summarize relevant basic statistics of the data in Table~\ref{tab:interactions}-\ref{tab:interests} below.
The tables distinguish the data from the App users and from
all App users and friends. Table~\ref{tab:interactions}
summarizes the number of records for each item (row) and interaction (column)
combination. Table~\ref{tab:demographics} shows 
some demographics from user profiles\footnote{Note that
count of schools are not unique as each user can attend more than one
degree of the same type.}.
