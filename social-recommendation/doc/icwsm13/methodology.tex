The major objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of \textit{Social Affinity Filtering(SAF)} and fine grained 
analysis of the informativeness of Interactions and Activities.We divide our recommendation algorithm into two categories based 
on Interactions and Activities of target user's \textit{ Social Affinity Groups(SAG)} with target item, 
namely \textit{Interaction  Social Affinity Groups(ISAG)} and \textit{Activity Social Affinity Groups(ASAG)}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Interaction  Social Affinity Groups}: We define the set of interaction affinity classes based on 
  Interaction modality, action and direction as
  \begin{quote}
  \begin{math}
  	\textit{Interaction Affinity Classes} = \{link, post, photo, video\} \times \{like, tag, comment\} \times \{incoming, outgoing\}
  \end{math}
  \end{quote}
  %Additionally, we add friendship interaction affinity class. \\
  We define 
  \begin{quote}
  \textit{ISAG(u, i)} : set of the users who have interaction $i$ with user $u$.\\
   For example,\\
   \textit{ISAG(u, link-like-incoming)} : set of all users who have liked link posted by user $u$. \\
   \textit{ISAG(u, link-like-outgoing)} : set of all users whose link is liked by user $u$. \\
  \end{quote}
\item \textbf{Activity Social Affinity Groups}: We define activity affinity groups based on group membership, page likes and user favourites.
	\begin{quote}
	\textit{ASAG(u, i)} : set of the users who share entity $i$ (group, page, favourite) with user $u$.   
	\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
Finally, we define
\begin{quote}
\begin{math}
likes(u,i) =  \begin{Bmatrix}
	  True & \text{if user $u$ likes item $i$}\\
	  False & \text{otherwise}
	  \end{Bmatrix}
\end{math}
\end{quote}
\subsection{Social Affinity Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Interaction Social Affinity Features} : We define Interaction affinity features for target user $u$ and item $i$ for 22 ISAG's classes 
  $ \langle X_{1},X_{2}\ldots,X_{k}\rangle$ as
  \begin{quote}
  \begin{math}
   X_{k,u,i} = \begin{Bmatrix}
   		True & if\ \exists\ v\in \ \ ISAG(u,k) \wedge likes(v,i)\\ \\
   		False & otherwise
   \end{Bmatrix}
  \end{math}
  \end{quote}
  Additionally we add friend feature which encodes whether the target item $i$ is liked by friend or not.
  \item \textbf{Activity Social Affinity Features} : We define activity affinity features for target user $u$ and item $i$   \
  $ \langle X_{1},X_{2}\ldots,X_{k}\rangle$ as\\ \\
  \begin{math}
   X_{k,u,i} = \begin{Bmatrix}
   		True & if\ \exists\ v\in \ ASAG(u,k) \wedge likes(v,i)\\ \\
   		False & otherwise
   \end{Bmatrix}
  \end{math}
	In our analysis we use only those features(groups, pages and favourites) that is joined/liked by atleast one of our app user.
\end{itemize}

With Affinity features defined, we use naive bayes, Logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether 
user likes the link or not. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithm is implemented using LIBLINER \cite{liblinear}.

Acknowledging the fact that, in real world social recommendation task, activitiy features grows very quickly as number of user in social 
networks increase we explore informativeness of social affinity features from the recommender system standpoint. Furthermore, its compelling
to understand informativeness of the interaction features. For fine grained analysis of activities and interactions we rank the features using
\textit{Conditional Entropy} H(Y$|$X=true).

\textit{Conditional Entropy} is defined as
\begin{quote}
\begin{math}
H(Y|X=True) = \\-\sum_{y\in{(like,dislike)}} p(y|X$=$true)$ $log( p(y|X$=$true))
\end{math}
\end{quote}
 Conditional Entropy measures the extent of discriminitiveness of the features.\\

With the data and methodology now defined including all dimensions of our analysis, we now proceed to an in-depth discussion of our findings.
