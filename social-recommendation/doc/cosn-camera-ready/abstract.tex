Content recommendation in social networks poses the complex problem of
learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of interactions
(e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) and
activities (e.g., favourites, group memberships, interests).  While
many social collaborative filtering approaches learn from aggregate
statistics over this social information, we show that only a small
subset of user interactions and activities are actually useful for
social recommendation, hence learning \emph{which} of these are most
informative is of critical importance.  To this end, we define a novel
social collaborative filtering approach termed social affinity
filtering (SAF).  On a preference dataset of Facebook users and their
interactions with 37,000+ friends collected over a four month period,
SAF learns which fine-grained interactions and activities are
informative and outperforms state-of-the-art (social)
collaborative filtering methods by over 6\% in prediction accuracy; 
SAF also exhibits strong cold-start performance.
In addition, we analyse various aspects of fine-grained social
features and show (among many insights) that interactions on video
content are more informative than other modalities (e.g.,
photos), the most informative activity groups tend to have small
memberships, and features corresponding to ``long-tailed'' content
(e.g., music and books) can be much more predictive than those with
fewer choices (e.g., interests and sports).  In summary, this work
demonstrates the substantial predictive power of fine-grained 
social features and the novel method of SAF to
leverage them for state-of-the-art social recommendation.
