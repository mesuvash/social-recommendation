Now we analyse the informativeness of Activity Social Affinity
Features (ASAFs) by looking at the correlation between the size and
type of groups, pages and favourites.

Fig~\ref{Fig3} provides scatter plots of conditional
entropies and logistic regression weights vs. activity group 
size.\footnote{Here the size of a {\em group}, {\em page} and {\em favourite}
is the number of total users in the activity group.  For {\em pages}
and {\em favourites} this is the total number of Facebook users,
whether or not they are in the App users' ego network, while for {\em
groups} only the number of users in the App users' ego network is
visible to our App.}  Both plots show that small activity groups
\emph{can} be highly predictive (low conditional entropy or
weights that deviate extremely from zero) whereas large groups are
\emph{rarely} predictive.

In Fig~\ref{Fig4} we plot the average conditional entropy of the top
10\% of features cumulative up to the size of the activity group given
on the x-axis.
%; this allows us to determine the marginal contribution
%of larger groups to the average conditional entropy as they 
%are incrementally added in.  
This graph distinctly shows that the
small sizes of groups, pages and favourites have low average
conditional entropy that transitions sharply to a higher average 
at about 50 for groups and $10^{5}$ for pages/favourites.

We also analyse predictiveness of favourites by categories obtained
from the Facebook API in Fig~\ref{Fig5}.  While half of category
instances in movie, books, or movies with ``long-tail'' (less popular,
specialised) content may not be highly predictive (judging by median
informativess), these categories do contain some highly predictive
instances (as evidenced by the top two quartiles).  On the contrary,
highly generic categories (e.g. interests) and those with fewer
choices (e.g. sports or fav-teams) tend to be less predictive overall.
These observations of Fig~\ref{Fig5} are also reiterated by the
examples provided in Table~\ref{table:fav_examples} where
uninformative favourites tend to have a broad appeal whereas
informative favourites generally appear much more specialised.  This
reinforces the insight of SAF that it is important to learn
which SAGs are predictive.

One might ask how the number of activities a user joins affects
recommendation performance.  In Fig~\ref{AccuracyVsmembership}, we see
that on average, more user activities generally leads to higher
accuracy.  As an alternative analysis, Fig~\ref{fig:features_overview}
shows performance vs.  the number of \emph{active features}, i.e., for
any (user,item) recommendation in a row of
Fig~\ref{fig:features_overview}, the active features are those that
are true (1).  Here we see that excessive item popularity among
activities hurts the discriminative power of SAF to make good
recommendations.

\caption{(top) Examples of 8 items per Favourite category near the \emph{median} conditional entropy (\emph{median informativeness}).
(bottom) Examples of top 8 items with the lowest conditional entropy
(\emph{most informative}).  A general trend is that more informative
favourite category ASAGs tend to be more specialised in appeal,
e.g. ``Avascular Necrosis'' is an informative music group favourite
--- its members tend to share common preferences --- while ``John
Lennon'' and ``U2'' have a broader audience with more diverse
preferences.
%#suvash#
Interestingly, ''Sherlock'' appears in both most and median
informative table but the median informative is an official page with
wide range of fans, whereas the most informative is a duplicate fan
page with few fans.}
