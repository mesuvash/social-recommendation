\section{Social Affinity filtering}

{\bf TODO: need to revise and describe features using uniform notation... Suvash used upper and I used lower case, need to follow Suvash's notation.}

%Social affinity filtering (SAF) is based on the idea that affinity
%between users expressed in social networks via interactions and
%activities is predictive of user preferences.  
Social affinity group and the associated features defined in Sec~\ref{ssec:SAfeature} 
are used to build predictors for $\likes(u,i)$ given features $X$.
%as follows: a classifier takes a user $u$ and item $i$ and must predict
%whether $\likes(u,i)$ given features that can be derived from the
%social network.  
In SAF, these features are the boolean
variables $X_{k,u,i}$ indicating whether any users in the $k$th SAG of
user $u$ also liked $i$.  For example, $k$ could be the SAG of $u$ for
the interaction of $\textit{link-like-incoming}$ or the activity of
liking the {\em Obama Re-Election Headquarters} Facebook page.  Then knowing whether
anyone in each SAG $k$ for user $u$ likes item $i$ provides a rich set
of fine-grained features for prediction.  It is up to SAF to learn how
to weight each SAG to aggregate their preferences into one final
prediction, which is done by training on historical data.

Formally, given a user $u$ and item $i$, a SAF classifier is a
function: $f: \x \to y$ where $y \in \{ \like, \dislike \}$ and $\x =
\langle u,i,x_1,\ldots,x_k \rangle$ where $x_j \in X_j$ ($1 \leq j
\leq k$) as previously formally defined in the Methodology.  To train $f$, one
simply provides a dataset of historical observations $D = \{ \langle
\x,y \rangle \}$, e.g., $f$ could be a linear classifier trained by an
SVM, logistic regression, or na\"{i}ve Bayes.  Then for future
predictions, we simply are given $\x$ and we ask the SAF classifier to
predict $y = f(\x)$.
