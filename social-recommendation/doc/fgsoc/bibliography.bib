The warranting principle states that judgments rely more heavily on other-generated than self-generated information because the former is more immune to manipulation. It is argued that the warranting principle becomes more important when more interpersonal traits have to be judged. In line with the expectations, other-generated information had only weak impact on the popularity judgments. With regard to communal orientation, other-generated information had stronger effects and qualified the effects of self-generated information. Only other-generated information had an impact on perceived social attraction.},

The sum of the number of oneâ€™s friends is a feature displayed on usersâ€™ profiles as a vestige of the friend connections a user has accrued. In contrast to offline social networks, individuals in online network systems frequently accrue friends numbering several hundred. The uncertain meaning of friend status in these systems raises questions about whether and how sociometric popularity conveys attractiveness in non-traditional, non-linear ways. An experiment examined the relationship between the number of friends a Facebook profile featured and observersâ€™ ratings of attractiveness and extraversion. A curvilinear effect of sociometric popularity and social attractiveness emerged, as did a quartic relationship between friend count and perceived extraversion. These results suggest that an overabundance of friend connections raises doubts about Facebook usersâ€™ popularity and desirability.},

The increasing popularity of SNSs such as Facebook (FB) implies a significant change in the way we interact with others. In an extensive longitudinal study (N = 311), carried out in Norway between 2008 - 2010, we examined the relationship between FB use and social capital, with a focus on interpersonal interaction, including face-to-face (F2F) interaction. Our findings suggest that overall FB use does not significantly affect offline capital, despite a significant increase in the use of FB from 2008 to 2010, after controlling for age, gender and education. However, different types of communication strategies on FB correlate with various kinds of F2F interaction. Importantly, FB users who focus on FB communication with their close friends, also interact more frequently with their close friends F2F, compared to those using FB to communicate with "online strangersâ€. The results also indicate that FB has become an important tool for keeping in touch with family members and existing friends rather than forming new connections.},

In this paper, we study how to utilize social influence for increasing the overall forum participation. To this end, we propose a mechanism to maximize user influence and boost participation by displaying forum threads to users. We formally define the participation maximization problem, and show that it is a special instance of the social welfare maximization problem with submodular utility functions and it is NP-hard. However, generic approximation algorithms is impracticable for real-world forums due to time complexity. Thus we design a heuristic algorithm, named Thread Allocation Based on Influence (TABI), to tackle the problem. Through extensive experiments using a dataset from a real-world online forum, we demonstrate that TABI consistently outperforms all other algorithms in maximizing participation. The results of this work demonstrates that current recommender systems can be made more effective by considering future influence propagations. The problem of participation maximization based on influence also opens a new direction in the study of social influence.},

We present the results of a survey designed to elicit cultural differences in peopleâ€™s social question asking behaviors across the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and India. The survey received responses from 933 people distributed across the four countries who held similar job roles and were employed by a single organization. Responses included information about the questions they ask via social networking tools, and their motivations for asking and answering questions online. The results reveal culture as a consistently significant factor in predicting peopleâ€™s social question and answer behavior. The prominent cultural differences we observe might be traced to peopleâ€™s inherent cultural characteristics (e.g., their cognitive patterns and social orientation), and should be comprehensively considered in designing social search systems.},

In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends. Also, we observe that a majority of the content propagated to cause trends arise from traditional media sources with social media acting as a selective amplifier for them.},

Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others â€” a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.},

Here we consider two of the most fundamental definitions of influence, one based on a small set of "snapshot'' observations of a social network and the other based on detailed temporal dynamics.  The former is particularly useful because large-scale social network data sets are often available only in snapshots or crawls.  The latter however provides a more detailed process model of how influence spreads.  We study the relationship between these two ways of measuring influence, in particular establishing how to infer the more detailed temporal measure from the more readily observable snapshot measure.  We validate our analysis using the history of social interactions on Wikipedia; the result is the first large-scale study to exhibit a direct relationship between snapshot and temporal models of social influence.},

Social media has made social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive quantities of data for empirical analysis.  These data sets offer a rich source of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them. However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it. We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites.  Specifically, we extract social networks of active users on Digg and Twitter, and track how interest in news stories spreads among them. We show that social networks play a crucial role in the spread of information on these sites, and that network structure affects dynamics of information flow.},

        abstract = {There is an ongoing debate, not just among academics but in popular culture, about whether social media can expand peopleâ€™s social networks, and whether online friends can be â€œrealâ€ friends. The debate refuses to die. This paper addresses this question subjectively, from the point of view of the user, and examines the predictors of acquiring new friends through social media use. This is a multi-method study with quantitative (n=617) and qualitative sections. Some previous studies have found a â€œrich-get-richerâ€ effect where people who are socially active offline appear to benefit most from online interactions. This paper is based on the idea that whether online friends can be real friends may be subject to a self-fulfilling prophecy: those who do not believe that online friendships can be real friendships are not likely to make such connections. I compare the â€œRich Get Richerâ€ and â€œSeek and Ye Shall Findâ€ models by examining relationships between the amount of offline socializing, amount of online social activity and the belief in online friendships. I also qualitatively examine reasons cited by respondents as to why online sociality is or is not a plausible route to meaningful friendship. The results show strong support for one of the earliest theories of computer-mediated-communication: hyperpersonal interaction. It appears that a sizable portion of the young generation finds online interaction positive because it is perceived to concentrate on the conversation itself, rather than on appearances, and is seen as freer of social judgments. African-Americans are significantly more likely to meet new friends online. There also appear to be underlying personality traits, apart from traditional demographic variables, that divide the population in terms of their attitude towards online sociality.},
