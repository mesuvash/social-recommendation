In this section we evaluate the correlation between the conditional
entropy and size of groups, pages and favourites.

Fig \ref{Fig3} shows the relationship between conditional
    entropy and logistic regression weights versus the size of activity
    groups. Here the size of a {\em group}, {\em page} and {\em favorite} 
    is the number of total users in the activity group. 
    For {\em Pages} and {\em Favorites} this is the total number of Facebook users, 
    whether or not they are in the App users' ego network, while for 
    {\em Groups} only the number of users in the App users' ego network is visible to our app.
    Both scatter plots shows that the activity groups of small size can be
    highly predictive (low conditional entropy or weights that deviate
    extremely from zero) whereas large groups are rarely predictive.

In Fig~\ref{Fig4} we plot the average conditional entropy of the top
    10\% of features cumulative up to the size of the activity group given on the
    x-axis; this allows us to determine the marginal contribution of
    larger groups to the average conditional entropy as larger groups
    are incrementally added in.  This graph 
    distinctly shows that the small sizes of groups, pages and favourites
    have low average conditional entropy that transitions sharply to a
    higher average once a size threshold has been met.  From 
    Fig~\ref{Fig4} we can infer that the group sizes up to 50 and
    page/favourite sizes up to $10^{5}$ are most predictive.

{\bf TODO: make this consistent with earlier discussion regarding persistence,
temporally sychronized.}

 We also analyze predictiveness of favourites by categories in
    Fig~\ref{Fig5}. It shows that SAGs consisting of shared interests,
    activity, television, and books are on average most predictive, while 
    music, movies, favourite teams, sports and athletes are on average
    least predictive.  While favourite teams, sports and athletes may be
    too focused to offer much predictiveness vs. the other more diverse
    categories, it is interesting that movies and music favourites
    are not very predictive on average.  This may have to do with the fact that
    these are typically ephemeral favourites that may be heavily influenced
    by popularity as opposed to true personal preference.
