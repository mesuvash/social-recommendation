Content recommendation in social networks poses the complex problem of
learning user preferences from a rich set of avialable social information.
%and complex set of interactions (e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) and
%activities (e.g., favourites, group memberships, page likes).  
While many social collaborative filtering approaches learn from aggregate statistics over the
social information, we propose a novel method, \textbf{\textit{social affinity filtering} (SAF)}, 
that take into account the fine-grained social interactions (e.g., likes, comments and tags for 
links, posts, photos and videos) and activites (eg, group memberships, page likes, favourites) 
information. We show that SAF yields higher accuracy than than a range of state-of-the-art 
(social) collaborative filtering approaches.

we propose a different approach that leverages the fine grain-interactions(e.g., likes, comments and tags for links, posts, photos and videos) 
and activites(eg, group memberships, page likes, favourites)
: we first define
social affinity groups (SAGs) of a target user by analysing their
fine-grained interactions (e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) 
and activities (e.g., group memberships, page likes, favourites).  Then we define Social 
affinity features based on SAGs and learn the target user's preferences
in a method we term \textbf{\textit{social affinity filtering} (SAF)}.}
%Then we learn which SAGs are most predictive of the target user's preferences
%in a method we term social affinity filtering (SAF).
%We substantiate the advantage and essence of learning via fine grained social information instead of aggregate
%statistics information theoritic analysis of the predictiveness of interactions and activity(based on size).
%We show that some interactions and activities are more predictive than others using information 
%theoritic analysis.
Furthermore, we provide information theoritic analysis of predictiveness of interactions and activities (based
on size).
