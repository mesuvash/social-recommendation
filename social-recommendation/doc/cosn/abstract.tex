Content recommendation in social networks poses the complex problem of
learning user preferences from a rich set of avialable social information.
%and complex set of interactions (e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) and
%activities (e.g., favourites, group memberships, page likes).  
While many social collaborative filtering approaches learn from aggregate statistics over the
social information, we propose a different approach: we first define
social affinity groups (SAGs) of a target user by analysing their
fine-grained interactions (e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) 
and activities (e.g., group memberships, page likes, favourites).  Then we define Social 
affinity features based on SAGs and learn the target user's preferences
in a method we term \textbf{\textit{social affinity filtering} (SAF)}.
%Then we learn which SAGs are most predictive of the target user's preferences
%in a method we term social affinity filtering (SAF). 
We apply SAF to preference data from a set of Facebook users and their
complete interactions with 38,000+ friends collected over a four month
period.
%Our analysis demonstrates that SAF yields higher accuracy
%than a range of state-of-the-art (social) collaborative filtering approaches and that not all
%interactions and activities are equally predictive: among many insights, 
%we show certain user-to-user interactions are more
%informative than others  
Our analysis demonstrates that SAF yields higher accuracy
than a range of state-of-the-art (social) collaborative filtering approaches and 
that not all interactions and activities are equally predictive: among many insights, 
we show certain user-to-user interactions are more
informative than others %(tagging is often more informative than
%commenting, video interactions are more informative than wall post
%interactions)
%we analyse trends in the relationship between the
%size of activity-based SAGs and informativeness
% (small groups can be
%highly informative while large groups are rarely informative).
and we show that activity informativeness varies significantly with size.
%In summary, this work demonstrates the previously untapped
%features and the novel method of SAF to leverage them for
%state-of-the-art social recommender systems.
