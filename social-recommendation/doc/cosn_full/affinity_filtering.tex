\subsection{Social Affinity filtering}

\emph{Social affinity filtering (SAF)} is based on the idea that
affinity between users expressed in social networks via interactions
and activities captured by SAGs is predictive of user preferences.
With SAGs now defined as in Sec~\ref{ssec:sag}, the task of SAF is
simply one of classification of a user $u$'s preference for a link $i$
as outlined in Fig~\ref{fig:overview}.  While a classification
approach to recommendation might evoke comparisons to standard
\emph{content-based filtering} (CBF)~\cite{newsweeder}, we remark that
CBF is not a social recommendation approach and unlike CBF, SAF does
not require explicit user features (e.g., age, gender, location, etc.)
or item descriptors (link text, link genre, etc.); in contrast, SAF
requires only social interactions and learns the affinities between a
user (ego) and the different set of alters as represented by SAGs that
the user interacts or shares common activities with.  SAF represents a
simple and efficient yet nonetheless novel approach to \emph{social
  recommendation} using fine-grained interaction and activity features
that has not been previously proposed in the literature.

Our task in SAF is to predict for a given user $u$ and item $i$
whether $\likes(u,i)$ is $\true$ or $\false$.  For this purpose,
we have the social affinity features $X_{k,u,i}$ defined in 
Sec~\ref{ssec:SAfeature} based on the various SAGs $k$ defined in 
Sec~\ref{ssec:sag}; the $X_{k,u,i}$ specifically correspond to boolean 
features indicating whether any users in the $k$th SAG of
user $u$ also liked $i$.  For example, $k$ could be the SAG of $u$ for
the interaction of $\textit{link-like-incoming}$ or the activity of
liking the {\em Obama Re-Election Headquarters} Facebook page.  Then knowing whether
anyone in each SAG $k$ for user $u$ likes item $i$ provides a rich set
of fine-grained features for prediction.  It is up to SAF to learn how
to weight each SAG $k$ to aggregate all SAF preferences into one final
prediction, which is done by training a classifier on historical data.

Formally, given a user $u$ and item $i$, a SAF classifier is simply a
function $$f: \x(u,i) \to \likes(u,i)$$ where $\likes(u,i) \in \{ \true
(\like), \dislike (\false) \}$ and $\x(u,i) = \langle
\cdots,X_{k,u,i},\cdots \rangle$ for all SAG's $k$.  To train $f$, one
simply provides a dataset of historical observations $D = \{ 
\x(u,i) \to \likes(u,i) \}$ where $f$ could be a linear
classifier trained by an SVM, logistic regression, or na\"{i}ve Bayes.
Then for future predictions, we simply are given a new user $u$ and
item $i$ to predict for and build the feature vector $\x(u,i)$ and 
predict $\likes(u,i)$ using the trained $f(\x(u,i))$.
