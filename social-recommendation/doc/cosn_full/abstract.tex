Content recommendation in social networks poses the complex problem of
learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of interactions
(e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) and
activities (e.g., favourites, group memberships, interests).  While
many social collaborative filtering approaches learn from aggregate
statistics over this social information, we show that only a small
subset of user interactions and activities are actually useful for
social recommendation, hence learning \emph{which} of these are most
informative is of critical importance.  To this end, we define a
novel social collaborative filtering approach termed social affinity
filtering (SAF).  
On a preference dataset of Facebook users and their 
interactions with 38,000+ friends collected over a four month period, 
SAF learns which fine-grained interactions and
activities are informative and \emph{outperforms} state-of-the-art
(social) collaborative filtering methods by at least 6\% in prediction
accuracy.
In addition, we carry out an analysis of various fine-grained social
features and show among other insights that interactions
on video content are more informative than other interaction
modalities (e.g., photos), the most informative activity groups tend
to have small memberships, and features corresponding to
``long-tailed'' content (e.g., music and books) can be much more
predictive than those with fewer choices (e.g., interests and sports).
%while common music
%preferences are less predictive on average than other favourite
%categories, some obscure music preferences are among the most
%informative features of all favourites.  
In summary, this work demonstrates the substantial predictive power of
fine-grained social interaction and activity features and the novel
method of SAF to leverage them for state-of-the-art social recommender
systems.
