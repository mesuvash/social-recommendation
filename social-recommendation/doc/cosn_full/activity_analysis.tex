% Note: activity SAGs can go beyond friends.

%In this section we evaluate the correlation between the conditional
%entropy and size of groups, pages and favourites.

Now we analyse the informativeness of Activity Social Affinity
Features (ASAFs) by looking at the correlation between the size and
type of groups, pages and favourites.

Fig \ref{Fig3} shows the relationship between both the conditional
    entropy and logistic regression weights vs. the size of activity
    groups. Here the size of a {\em group}, {\em page} and {\em favourite} 
    is the number of total users in the activity group. 
    For {\em pages} and {\em pavorites} this is the total number of Facebook users, 
    whether or not they are in the App users' ego network, while for 
    {\em groups} only the number of users in the App users' ego network is visible to our app.
    Both scatter plots shows that the activity groups of small size can be
    highly predictive (low conditional entropy or weights that deviate
    extremely from zero) whereas large groups are rarely predictive.

In Fig~\ref{Fig4} we plot the average conditional entropy of the top
    10\% of features cumulative up to the size of the activity group given on the
    x-axis; this allows us to determine the marginal contribution of
    larger groups to the average conditional entropy as larger groups
    are incrementally added in.  This graph 
    distinctly shows that the small sizes of groups, pages and favourites
    have low average conditional entropy that transitions sharply to a
    higher average once a size threshold has been met.  From 
    Fig~\ref{Fig4} we can infer that the group sizes up to 50 and
    page/favourite sizes up to $10^{5}$ are most predictive.

%{\bf TODO: make this consistent with earlier discussion regarding persistence,
%temporally sychronized.}

 We also analyse predictiveness of favourites by categories in
    Fig~\ref{Fig5}, where the favorite category labels are obtained from the Facebook API.  
    %It shows that SAGs consisting of shared interests,
    %activity, television, and books are on average most predictive, while 
    %music, movies, favourite teams, sports and athletes are on average
    %least predictive.  
    We can see that contents in the ``long-tail'', i.e.,  
    having a large number of occurrences far from the most popular choices, 
    tend to have some of the most predictive indidividual affinities. Examples of these include
    music, books, movies. On the contrary, generic affinities (e.g. interests) and 
    those with a smaller number of choices (e.g. sports or fav-teams) 
    tend to be less predictive since they represent less specialised interests than 
    the long tail of music, book, or movie preferences.  

    These observations of Fig~\ref{Fig5} are also reiterated by the
    examples provided in Table~\ref{table:fav_examples} where uninformative favourites
    tend to have a broad appeal whereas informative favourites generally appear much
    more specialised.  This also reinforces the point that not all SAGs are predictive,
    but some are very predictive and it is important to learn which SAGs are informative
    rather than nai\"{v}ly aggregate their content, where on average, the features are
    clearly not informative.
   
    %#suvash#
    In Fig~\ref{fig:AccuracyVsactiveFeats} we analyse the relationship between accuracy and
    number of active features i.e. features that are true. We can see that accuracy increase as number of
    active features increases but then starts to decrese sharply. This may be due to the fact that items
    with large number of active features are likely to be general items, liked by wide variety of users,
    which makes it hard for SAF to make personalised prediction. 
    %While favourite teams, sports and athletes may be
    %too focused to offer much predictiveness vs. the other more diverse
    %categories, it is interesting that movies and music favourites
    %are not very predictive on average.  This may have to do with the fact that
    %these are typically ephemeral favourites that may be heavily influenced
    %by popularity as opposed to true personal preference.
%\end{itemize}

%In Fig~\ref{Fig4} we plot the average conditional entropy of top
%    10\% features cumulative over the size of activity group. It
%    distinctly shows that the small sized group, pages and favourites
%    have low average conditional entropy. Furthermore, it explains
%    average conditional entropy decreases as size increases. From the
%    figure \ref{Fig4} we can infer that the group size upto 50 and
%    page/favourite size upto $10^{5}$ can be highly predictive.
%
%We also analyze predictiveness of favourites by categories in
%    Fig \ref{Fig5}. It shows that television, books, music and movies
%    are predictive whereas favourite teams, sports and athletes are
%    less predictive.

\caption{(top) Examples of 10 items per Favourite category near the \emph{median} conditional entropy (\emph{median informativeness}).
(bottom) Examples of top 10 items with the lowest conditional entropy (\emph{most informative}).
A general trend is that more informative favourite category ASAGs tend to be more specialised in
appeal, e.g. ``Avascular Necrosis'' is an informative music group favourite --- its members
tend to share common preferences --- while ``John Lennon'' and ``U2'' have a broader audience with
more diverse preferences. 
%#suvash#
Interestingly, ''Sherlock''  appears in both most and median informative table but the median informative is
an official page with wide range of fans, whereas the most informative is a duplicate fan page with few number of fans.}
